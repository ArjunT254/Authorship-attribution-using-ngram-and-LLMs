# Authorship-attribution-using-ngram-and-LLMs

This GitHub repository contains an project focused on the authorship attribution problem, which involves determining the author of a given text. The project includes the implementation of both generative (n-gram language model) and discriminative (sequence classifier) solutions. The goal is to write code for these solutions and compare the results to explore the effectiveness of each approach in identifying text authors.
